## Technical Details

### HTML Structure

The app's HTML structure consists of a container element that holds the timer display, start/reset buttons, and any other UI elements.

### JavaScript Functions

The app's JavaScript code includes the following functions:

1. `startTimer()`: Starts the timer countdown.
2. `resetTimer()`: Resets the timer to the initial work duration.
3. `TimerDisplay()`: Updates the timer display with the remaining time.

### Timer Logic

The timer logic is implemented using the `setInterval()` function to update the timer display every second. The app keeps track of the current mode (work or break) and the remaining time, switching between the two modes as the timer counts down.

### User Interaction

The app handles user interactions, such as clicking the start, pause, and reset buttons, by calling the corresponding JavaScript functions and updating the timer state accordingly.

- **Pause Functionality** Introduction of a pause functionality in the middle of a session.
- **Settings**: Introduce a settings interface to allow users to customize the work and break durations.
- **Incoporate Work/Study friendly Sound** This feature would add music while you work, code or study.
- **History Tracking**: Implement a feature to track the user's Pomodoro history, including completed work sessions and breaks.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Optimize the app's layout and user experience for mobile devices.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the app works seamlessly across different web browsers.
